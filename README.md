#Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (Chem 280).

Toi make a commit ("version" or "Checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that up would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the `git add FILENAME` command.
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using `git commit -m "Message about what you did"`.
